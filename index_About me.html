							<h1>Henk Han Sheng Hsieh</h1>
							<hr>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/myself.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hi, my name is Henk Han Sheng Hsieh. I’m currently a Year 3 student in the Department of Communication and Technology at National Chiao Tung University, studying Human-Computer Interaction design and Strategic Communication. Also, I am a visual designer at AppleCat Design Studio, specialising in key visual design, package design, layout design and infographic design. Recently, I have started working on user experience design and user interface design as my new field of career, and learning HTML/CSS skills by self-teaching.</p>
							<p>Studying communication isn’t merely about pursuing a future position for me, but also learning a whole new aspect of how people interact with each other. I believe the origin of creativity is based on the involvement of social interaction with different groups of people. During the past two years in college, I have been working on improving my professional skills by attending different clubs and events, putting myself into various immersive challenges where I am able to meet folks from diverse backgrounds and seize opportunities to keep myself well equipped.</p><p> Aside from that, I’m also a socially cautious person who focus on political, gender, labour and educational issues in Taiwan and the world. Being a journalist at Castnet and the international volunteer in India allowed me to participate social issues in person and extended my experiences to the streets where I can truly get in touch with people in need and identify problems. These experiences have made me expect myself to incorporate the sense of social responsibility into my works in the future and create meaningful design that conveys significant messages to the people.</p>
