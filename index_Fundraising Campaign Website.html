							<p>Located in Leh, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, India, Jamyang School is a secular boarding school founded under Dalai Lama’s will in 2008, offering free education to Himalayan children from the remote area around the boundaries between India, Pakistan and China. The school now provides the educational programmes from nursery to 10th grades and hosts the accommodation to nearly 300 students on campus. Currently, there are 40 staffs in total, including 18 teachers and 22 administrative staffs, working for the school. Leading by two monks, also the director and the principal, the school is also well known for its Tibetan Buddhism education, of which one of the main religions in Ladakh, that guides the students with the philosophy and Tibetan culture.</p>
							<p> For long, Jamyang School has been sponsored by different charities and trusts from the Western society, which they often find themselves in conflict with. The deficiency of internal communication and the cultural differences have caused the termination of sponsorship cooperation with the Western sponsors. Without sufficient sponsorship, the school is currently under the financial crisis that will jeopardise students’ opportunity to education. In order to re-establish the financial assistance, not only the school has to readjust the internal organisational communication, the external image and public relation are also the crucial points that require the optimisation to help people understanding more about the school and learning the problem that they are currently facing. Furthermore, cultural differences have always been another major problem that causes the conflict within the public relation of the school, therefore, we decided to introduce the school to the new key public in Taiwan that shares the similar cultural background with by offering an informative one-scroll webpage as part of the campaign that explained the current situation of Jamyang School. </p>
