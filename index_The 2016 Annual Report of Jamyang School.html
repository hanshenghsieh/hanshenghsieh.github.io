							<h1>The 2016 Annual Report of Jamyang School</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Located in Leh, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, India, Jamyang School is a secular boarding school founded under Dalai Lamaâ€™s will in 2008, offering free education to Himalayan children from the remote area around the boundaries between India, Pakistan and China. The school now provides the educational programmes from nursery to 10th grades and hosts the accommodation to nearly 300 students on campus. Currently, there are 40 staffs in total, including 18 teachers and 22 administrative staffs, working for the school. Leading by two monks, also the director and the principal, the school is also well known for its Tibetan Buddhism education, of which one of the main religions in Ladakh, that guides the students with the philosophy and Tibetan culture.</p>
							<p>For long, Jamyang School has received most of their sponsorship from Western trusts and charity. However, with regards to cultural differences and the inefficient internal communication, the school often finds itself in conflict with the organisations that support the financial aid to the students of Jamyang School. In 2015, several organisations decided to terminate the sponsorship cooperation with Jamyang School for not knowing where the money has been spent after a series of inefficient communication. Therefore, as part of the campaign, we decided to start with the maintenance of the relation with the present sponsors in Taiwan by giving them the general information of the school and financial brief.</p>
