							<h1>The 2016 Annual Report of Jamyang School</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p> Located in Leh, Ladakh, J&K, India, Jamyang School is a secular boarding school founded under Dalai Lama’s will in 2008, offering free education to Himalayan children from the remote area around the boundaries between India, Pakistan and China. The school now provides the educational programmes from nursery to 10th grades and hosts the accommodation to nearly 300 students on campus. Currently, there are 40 staffs in total, including 18 teachers and 22 administrative staffs, working for the school. Leading by two monks, also the director and the principal, the school is also well known for its Tibetan Buddhism education, of which one of the main religions in Ladakh, that guides the students with the philosophy and Tibetan culture.
	At the beginning two years, the school was fully sponsored by the Dalai Lama trust. Yet, the school started looking for their own financial support from the public, of which now covers their educational spending, meanwhile, the Dalai Lama trust continually sponsors half of the spending of the school, mainly administrative spending such as staff wages, construction fees etc.</p>
							<p>With regards to the lack of educational resources in rural areas of the region, Dalai Lama decided to start a new school in Leh, the capital city of Ladakh, that aims to give children in need an opportunity to make a change in their life by receiving the standard education without facing financial challenges. Every admitted student come from the families struggling with serious difficulties and often aren’t able to support their children in regular schools. The school believes the education is not only about gaining knowledge or yielding wealth by having a decent position in the future, but also giving the student the sense of compassion and wisdom that lead them to become a fair-minded person of integrity.</p>
							<p> The school also aims to provide a thorough 12 years standard education system for the students, yet due to the limitation of the educational policy from the Indian government that 11th and 12th grade require further specific subjects, of which now the school still isn’t able to afford the wages for extra teaching staffs. Therefore, the students finish the school at 10th grade and transfer to other high schools in the region under the guidance and the financial assistance of the school.</p>
							<p>For long, the Jamyang School has received most of their sponsorship from Western trusts and charity, such as Tara trust[9]. However, with regards to cultural differences and the inefficient internal communication, the school often finds itself in conflict with the organisations that support the financial aid to the students of the Jamyang School. In 2015, several organisations decided to terminate the sponsorship cooperation with the Jamyang School for not knowing where the money has been spent after a series of inefficient communication. As a result, the school is now under the financial crisis which has been seriously threatening the support system that provides the educational opportunity to the students in need. Without sufficient financial aid, the school may be no longer able to support the whole amount of the students.</p>
							<p> Therefore, despite the problem within the internally organisational communication of the Jamyang School, one of the most crucial object to achieve is to rebuild the financial assistant channels that support the operation system of the school and prevent the students from facing the problem of being dropped off by establishing a whole new image of the school itself to the public. Whereas different from the previous public relation strategy, the present strategy aims to introduce the Jamyang School to the Asian community, which can be taken as an opportunity to explore new potential resources that share the similar background with the school in order to reduce the cultural differences in the future communication.</p>
